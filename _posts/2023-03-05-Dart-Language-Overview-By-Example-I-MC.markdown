This collection is not exhaustive—it’s just a brief introduction to the language **for people who like to learn by example**. You might also want to check out the language and library tours, or the [Dart cheatsheet codelab](https://dart.dev/codelabs/dart-cheatsheet).

### Hello World
Every app has a **main()** function. To display text on the console, you can use the top-level **print()** function:
```
void main() {
  print('Hello, World!');
}
```

### Variables
Even in type-safe Dart code, **most variables don’t need explicit types**, thanks to type inference:

```
var name = 'Voyager I';
var year = 1977;
var antennaDiameter = 3.7;
var flybyObjects = ['Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune'];
var image = {
  'tags': ['saturn'],
  'url': '//path/to/saturn.jpg'
};
```

Read more about variables in Dart, including default values, the final and const keywords, and static types.

### Control flow statements
Dart supports the usual control flow statements:

```
if (year >= 2001) {
  print('21st century');
} else if (year >= 1901) {
  print('20th century');
}

for (var object in flybyObjects) {
  print(object);
}

for (int month = 1; month <= 12; month++) {
  print(month);
}

while (year < 2016) {
  year += 1;
}
```

Read more about control flow statements in Dart, including break and continue, switch and case, and assert.

### Functions
We recommend **specifying the types of each function’s arguments and return value**:

```
int fibonacci(int n) {
  if (n == 0 || n == 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

var result = fibonacci(20);
```
A shorthand ```=>```  (arrow) syntax is **handy for functions that contain a single statement**. This syntax is especially useful when passing **anonymous functions** as arguments:

```
flybyObjects.where((name) => name.contains('turn')).forEach(print);
```
Besides showing an anonymous function (the argument to where()), this code shows that you can use a function as an argument: the top-level print() function is an argument to forEach().

Read more about functions in Dart, including **optional parameters, default parameter values**, and lexical scope.

### Comments
Dart comments usually start with //.

```
// This is a normal, one-line comment.

/// This is a documentation comment, used to document libraries,
/// classes, and their members. Tools like IDEs and dartdoc treat
/// doc comments specially.

/* Comments like these are also supported. */
```
Read more about comments in Dart, including how the documentation tooling works.

### Imports
To access APIs defined in other libraries, use import.

```
// Importing core libraries
import 'dart:math';

// Importing libraries from external packages
import 'package:test/test.dart';

// Importing files
import 'path/to/my_other_file.dart';
```

Read more about libraries and visibility in Dart, including library prefixes, show and hide, and **lazy loading** through the deferred keyword.

### Classes
Here’s an example of a class with three properties, two constructors, and a method. One of the properties can’t be set directly, so it’s defined using a getter method (instead of a variable).

```
class Spacecraft {
  String name;
  DateTime launchDate;

  // Constructor, with syntactic sugar for assignment to members.
  Spacecraft(this.name, this.launchDate) {
    // Initialization code goes here.
  }

  // Named constructor that forwards to the default one.
  Spacecraft.unlaunched(String name) : this(name, null);

  int get launchYear =>
      launchDate?.year; // read-only non-final property

  // Method.
  void describe() {
    print('Spacecraft: $name');
    if (launchDate != null) {
      int years =
          DateTime.now().difference(launchDate).inDays ~/
              365;
      print('Launched: $launchYear ($years years ago)');
    } else {
      print('Unlaunched');
    }
  }
}
```
You might use the Spacecraft class like this:

```
var voyager = Spacecraft('Voyager I', DateTime(1977, 9, 5));
voyager.describe();

var voyager3 = Spacecraft.unlaunched('Voyager III');
voyager3.describe();
```

Read more about classes in Dart, including initializer lists, optional new and const, redirecting constructors, factory constructors, getters, setters, and much more.

### Inheritance
Dart has **single inheritance**.

```
class Orbiter extends Spacecraft {
  num altitude;
  Orbiter(String name, DateTime launchDate, this.altitude)
      : super(name, launchDate);
}
```

Read more about extending classes, the optional **@override annotation**, and more.

### Mixins
Mixins are a way of **reusing code in multiple class hierarchies**. The following class can act as a mixin:

```
class Piloted {
  int astronauts = 1;
  void describeCrew() {
    print('Number of astronauts: $astronauts');
  }
}
```

To add a mixin’s capabilities to a class, just extend the class with the mixin.

```
class PilotedCraft extends Spacecraft with Piloted {
  // ···
}
```
PilotedCraft now has the astronauts field as well as the describeCrew() method.

Read more about mixins.

### Interfaces and abstract classes
Dart has no interface keyword. Instead, **all classes implicitly define an interface**. Therefore, you can implement any class.

```
class MockSpaceship implements Spacecraft {
  // ···
}
```
Read more about implicit interfaces.

You can create an **abstract class** to be extended (or implemented) by a concrete class. Abstract classes can contain **abstract methods** (with empty bodies).

```
abstract class Describable {
  void describe();

  void describeWithEmphasis() {
    print('=========');
    describe();
    print('=========');
  }
}
```
Any class extending Describable has the describeWithEmphasis() method, which calls the extender’s implementation of describe().

Read more about abstract classes and methods.

### Async
**Avoid callback hell and make your code much more readable by using async and await**.

```
const oneSecond = Duration(seconds: 1);
// ···
Future<void> printWithDelay(String message) async {
  await Future.delayed(oneSecond);
  print(message);
}
```
The method above is equivalent to:

```
Future<void> printWithDelay(String message) {
  return Future.delayed(oneSecond).then((_) {
    print(message);
  });
}
```
As the next example shows, **async** and **await** help make asynchronous code easy to read.

```
Future<void> createDescriptions(Iterable<String> objects) async {
  for (var object in objects) {
    try {
      var file = File('$object.txt');
      if (await file.exists()) {
        var modified = await file.lastModified();
        print(
            'File for $object already exists. It was modified on $modified.');
        continue;
      }
      await file.create();
      await file.writeAsString('Start describing $object in this file.');
    } on IOException catch (e) {
      print('Cannot create description for $object: $e');
    }
  }
}
```

You can also use ```async*```, which gives you a nice, readable way to build streams.


```
Stream<String> report(Spacecraft craft, Iterable<String> objects) async* {
  for (var object in objects) {
    await Future.delayed(oneSecond);
    yield '${craft.name} flies by $object';
  }
}
```
Read more about asynchrony support, including async functions, Future, Stream, and the asynchronous loop (await for).

### Exceptions
To raise an exception, use throw:

```
if (astronauts == 0) {
  throw StateError('No astronauts.');
}
```
To catch an exception, use a try statement with on or catch (or both):

```
try {
  for (var object in flybyObjects) {
    var description = await File('$object.txt').readAsString();
    print(description);
  }
} on IOException catch (e) {
  print('Could not describe object: $e');
} finally {
  flybyObjects.clear();
}
```
Note that the code above is asynchronous; try works for both synchronous code and code in an async function.
