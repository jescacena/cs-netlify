Vue.js is an **open-source Model```–```view```–```viewmodel JavaScript framework** for building user interfaces and single-page applications.

It was created by **Evan You**, and is maintained by him and the rest of the active core team members coming from various companies such as Netlify and Netguru.

Vue.js features an incrementally adoptable architecture that **focuses on declarative rendering and component composition**. 

Advanced features required for complex applications such as routing, state management and build tooling are offered via officially maintained supporting libraries and packages, with *Nuxt.js* as one of the most popular solutions.

Vue.js lets you extend HTML with HTML attributes called **directives**. The directives offer functionality to HTML applications,and come as either built-in or user defined directives.

#### History
Vue was created by Evan You after working for Google using AngularJS in a number of projects. He later summed up his thought process: 
>-I figured, what if I could just extract the part that I really liked about Angular and build something really lightweight-

The first source code commit to the project was dated July 2013, and Vue was first released the following February, in 2014.
