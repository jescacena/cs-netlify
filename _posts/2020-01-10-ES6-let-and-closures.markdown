Functions can be nested inside other functions. 
Consider the next code:

```
(function autorun(){
    let x = 1;
    function log(){ 
       console.log(x); 
    }
    log();
})();
```
log() is a nested function inside the autorun() function.Â log() accesses the variable x from its outer function. The log() function is a closure.
