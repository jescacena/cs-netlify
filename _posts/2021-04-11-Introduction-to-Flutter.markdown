#### What is Flutter?
Flutter is a Google's portable UI toolkit. In other words, itâ€™s a **comprehensive app Software Development Kit (SDK)**, complete with widgets and tools.

#### What's Flutter for?
Flutter **enables cross-platform app development**. It gives developers an easy way to build and deploy visually attractive, natively-compiled applications for mobile (iOS, Android), web, and desktop , all using a single codebase.

#### Who created Flutter?
A **team at Google built Flutter**. But as an **open-source** project, both Google and the Flutter community contribute to its development. A brief history:
- February 2018, Mobile World Congress .First beta release of Flutter
- September 2019, Flutter 1.9 release

Flutter is now **one of the top 20 active software repositories** on GitHub (16th place as of December 11, 2019), which proves the developer community uses it and continues to contribute to its improvement.

#### A little more about Flutter

- It's **free** and **open source**
- It's based on **Dart** , a fast, object-oriented programming language (Google released Dart 2.3 with new support for UI-as-code features , note that Dart is now in its 2.6 version). Dart is relatively new, and is easy to learn , especially for experienced developers more familiar with Java and C#
- The architecture is based on the very popular **reactive programming** (it follows the same style as React)
- It provides its **own widgets, drawn from its own high-performance rendering engine** , these are fast, attractive and customizable
- Thanks to the widget experience,**Flutter apps have a great look and feel** (while you can still create your own custom app design using readily-available UI elements that follow specific platform guidelines)
