It can **control the layout of multiple web pages all at once**\n- External stylesheets are stored in **CSS files**\n  \n\n#### Why Use CSS?\n**CSS is used to define styles for your web pages**, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. \n  \n\n#### CSS Solved a Big Problem\nHTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!\n\nHTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:\n\n```\n<h1>This is a heading</h1>\n\n<p>This is a paragraph.</p>\n```\n\n> When tags like ``<font>``, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.\n\nTo solve this problem, the **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS**.\n\nCSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!\n  \n\n#### CSS Saves a Lot of Work!\n*The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files*.\n\nWith an external stylesheet file, **you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!**\n\n","references":"- [W3C - Css intro](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp)","featured_image_url":"https://codersnack.com/assets/images/logo-css.jpg","slug":"introducing-css","weblink":"https://codersnack.com/introducing-css","featured_image_preview":{"id":17,"name":"logo-css.jpg","hash":"fe9c37e7c6094541bf01b7581ae83859","sha256":"6H8KSFMpaiYF1EcUIuOenxvCZOimG_n+4EMa-OZ2X2E","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":44.74,"url":"/uploads/fe9c37e7c6094541bf01b7581ae83859.jpg","provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-01-09T22:34:40.442Z","updated_at":"2020-01-09T22:34:40.442Z"}},"codersnacks_category":{"id":5,"header":"CSS","description":"CSS - Cascade Style Sheets","snacks_by_cat_json_filename":"css.snacks.json","key":"css","image_url":"https://codersnack.com/assets/images/logo-css.jpg","created_at":"2020-01-09T22:10:20.346Z","updated_at":"2020-01-09T22:10:20.346Z","image_preview":{"id":16,"name":"logo-css.jpg","hash":"e3552e97cc7b45ca8f96b379270d787d","sha256":"6H8KSFMpaiYF1EcUIuOenxvCZOimG_n+4EMa-OZ2X2E","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":44.74,"url":"/uploads/e3552e97cc7b45ca8f96b379270d787d.jpg","provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-01-09T22:10:20.356Z","updated_at":"2020-01-09T22:10:20.356Z"}},"title":"css - introducing css","created_at":"2020-01-09T22:35:04.342Z","updated_at":"2020-01-09T22:35:04.344Z"}]
