It has a virtual DOM, JSX components, input properties, and props. Also, each React component has a state and a lifecycle.\n\n#### Virtual DOM\nInstead of constantly having to work with the real DOM, which is very expensive, everything is handled virtually until we absolutely need to update the DOM. \n\n#### JSX \nIt is officially an XML-like syntax that is close to HTML, but not quite HTML. It is actually JavaScript with HTML sprinkled in.\n\nExample\n\n```\nclass Welcome extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;\n  }\n}\n```\n","references":"[Fun with React - A quick overview](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/fun-with-react-a-quick-overview)","featured_image_url":"https://codersnack.com/assets/images/logo-reactjs.png","slug":"react-what-is","weblink":"https://codersnack.com/react-what-is/","featured_image_preview":{"id":8,"name":"logo-reactjs.png","hash":"51404cadac89402c960c70f6a9cc9b4a","sha256":"ek-ixAp6Ir6UtlIEoswH3vum83sE3lYiacTqgsQHpCI","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":10.75,"url":"/uploads/51404cadac89402c960c70f6a9cc9b4a.png","provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2019-12-31T20:04:40.889Z","updated_at":"2019-12-31T20:04:40.889Z"}},"codersnacks_category":{"id":2,"header":"ReactJS","description":"ReactJS","snacks_by_cat_json_filename":"reactjs.snacks.json","key":"reactjs","image_url":"https://codersnack.com/assets/images/logo-reactjs.png","created_at":"2019-12-31T19:51:23.456Z","updated_at":"2020-01-04T11:09:32.516Z","image_preview":{"id":4,"name":"logo-reactjs.png","hash":"184e26e835dc4e16ad7789a8ca97d25d","sha256":"ek-ixAp6Ir6UtlIEoswH3vum83sE3lYiacTqgsQHpCI","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":10.75,"url":"/uploads/184e26e835dc4e16ad7789a8ca97d25d.png","provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2019-12-31T19:51:23.474Z","updated_at":"2019-12-31T19:51:23.474Z"}},"title":"ReactJS - What is ReactJS","created_at":"2019-12-31T20:14:05.872Z","updated_at":"2019-12-31T20:17:02.216Z"}]
