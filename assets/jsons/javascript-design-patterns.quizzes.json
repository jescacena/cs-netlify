These problems usually have many similarities, and, when trying to solve them, we notice several common patterns. This is where design patterns come in.\n\n> A design pattern is a term used in software engineering for a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.\n\n*Design patterns are by no means finished solutions*. They only provide us with **approaches or schemes to solve a problem**. The underlying concept of design patterns has been around in the software engineering industry since the very beginning, but they weren't really so formalised. \n\nDesign patterns are beneficial for various reasons. They are proven solutions that industry veterans have tried and tested. They are solid approaches that solve issues in a widely accepted way and reflect the experience and insights of the industry-leading developers that helped define them. Patterns also **make your code more reusable and readable while speeding up the development process vastly**.\n\n**Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (1994)** is a software engineering book describing software design patterns. The book was written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, with a foreword by Grady Booch. The book is divided into two parts, with the first two chapters exploring the capabilities and pitfalls of object-oriented programming, and the remaining chapters describing 23 classic software design patterns. The book includes examples in C++ and Smalltalk.\n\n### Categories of Design Patterns\nDesign patterns are usually categorized into three major groups.\n\n#### Creational Design Patterns\nAs the name suggests, these patterns are for handling object creational mechanisms. A creational design pattern basically solves a problem by **controlling the creation process of an object**.\nIncludes: *Constructor Pattern*, *Factory Pattern*, *Prototype Pattern*, and *Singleton Pattern*.\n\n#### Structural Design Patterns\nThese patterns are concerned with **class and object composition**. They help structure or restructure one or more parts without affecting the entire system. In other words, they help obtain new functionalities without tampering with the existing ones.\nIncludes: *Adapter Pattern*, *Composite Pattern*, *Decorator Pattern,* *Façade Pattern*, *Flyweight Pattern*, and *Proxy Pattern*.\n\n#### Behavioral Design Patterns\nThese patterns are concerned with **improving communication between dissimilar objects**.\nIncludes: *Chain of Responsibility Pattern*, *Command Pattern*, *Iterator Pattern*, *Mediator Pattern*, *Observer Pattern*, *State Pattern*, S*trategy Pattern*, and *Template Pattern*.\n","references":"- [Medium - javascript design patterns](https://medium.com/better-programming/javascript-design-patterns-25f0faaaa15?)\n- [Wikipedia - Desgin Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)","featured_image_url":"https://codersnack.com/assets/images/design-patterns.jpg","slug":"design-pattern-what-is","weblink":"https://codersnack.com/what-is-a-design-pattern","featured_image_preview":{"id":13,"name":"design-patterns.jpg","hash":"4f21ae7a28fc41a892d1e97913389dc0","sha256":"VsHmj4Ik_4HvdSZoE8wLe3nE7RbkzGzaMehB3mO1T4A","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":23.12,"url":"/uploads/4f21ae7a28fc41a892d1e97913389dc0.jpg","provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-01-09T20:02:23.437Z","updated_at":"2020-01-09T20:02:23.437Z"}},"codersnacks_quiz":{"id":7,"question":"what is the purpose of design patterns?","response_valid":"Being an approach fro solving commonly occurring problem in software design.","response_invalid1":"A guide for visual components","response_invalid2":"Patterns for beginning a project","created_at":"2020-01-06T18:20:24.891Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T18:20:24.891Z"},"codersnacks_category":{"id":3,"header":"Javascript design patterns","description":"Re-usable forms of a solution to common design problem with examples in JS","snacks_by_cat_json_filename":"javascript-design-patterns.snacks.json","key":"javascript-design-patterns","image_url":"https://codersnack.com/assets/images/design-patterns.jpg","created_at":"2019-12-31T19:53:03.454Z","updated_at":"2020-01-27T20:11:09.733Z","image_preview":{"id":5,"name":"design-patterns.jpg","hash":"da61a2c1b67445b99b18a96470e15d63","sha256":"VsHmj4Ik_4HvdSZoE8wLe3nE7RbkzGzaMehB3mO1T4A","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":23.12,"url":"/uploads/da61a2c1b67445b99b18a96470e15d63.jpg","provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2019-12-31T19:53:03.466Z","updated_at":"2019-12-31T19:53:03.466Z"}},"title":"JS design pattern - what is the purpose","created_at":"2020-01-06T18:21:06.405Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T18:22:47.371Z"},{"id":19,"codersnack":{"id":20,"header":"Adapter pattern","created_at":"2020-01-25T18:44:26.680Z","updated_at":"2020-02-20T22:03:57.444Z","explanation":"This is a *structural pattern* where **the interface of one class is translated into another**. \n\nThis pattern **lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces**.\n\nThis pattern is **often used to create wrappers for new refactored APIs so that other existing old APIs can still work with them**.

In this pattern, each node in the tree-like structure can be either an individual object or a composed collection of objects. Regardless, each node is treated uniformly.\n\nIt is a bit complex to visualize this pattern. **The easiest way to think about this is with the example of a multi-level menu**. Each node can be a distinct option, or it can be a menu itself, which has multiple options as its child. A node component with children is a composite component, while a node component without any child is a leaf component.\n\nIn this example, we create a base class of *Component* that implements the common functionalities needed and abstracts the other methods needed. The base class also has a static method that utilises *recursion to traverse a composite tree structure made with its subclasses*. Then we create two subclasses extending the base class , *Leaf* that does not have any children and *Composite* that can have children, and hence have methods handling adding, searching, and removing child functionalities. The two subclasses are used to create a composite structurem, a tree, in this case.\n\n```\nclass Component {\n  constructor(name) {\n    this._name = name;\n  }\n\n  getNodeName() {\n    return this._name;\n  }\n\n  // abstract methods that need to be overridden\n  getType() {}\n\n  addChild(component) {}\n\n  removeChildByName(componentName) {}\n\n  removeChildByIndex(index) {}\n\n  getChildByName(componentName) {}\n\n  getChildByIndex(index) {}\n\n  noOfChildren() {}\n\n  static logTreeStructure(root) {\n    let treeStructure = '';\n    function traverse(node, indent = 0) {\n      treeStructure += `${'--'.repeat(indent)}${node.getNodeName()}\\n`;\n      indent++;\n      for (let i = 0, length = node.noOfChildren(); i < length; i++) {\n        traverse(node.getChildByIndex(i), indent);\n      }\n    }\n\n    traverse(root);\n    return treeStructure;\n  }\n}\n\nclass Leaf extends Component {\n  constructor(name) {\n    super(name);\n    this._type = 'Leaf Node';\n  }\n\n  getType() {\n    return this._type;\n  }\n\n  noOfChildren() {\n    return 0;\n  }\n}\n\nclass Composite extends Component {\n  constructor(name) {\n    super(name);\n    this._type = 'Composite Node';\n    this._children = [];\n  }\n\n  getType() {\n    return this._type;\n  }\n\n  addChild(component) {\n    this._children = [...this._children, component];\n  }\n\n  removeChildByName(componentName) {\n    this._children = [...this._children].filter(component => component.getNodeName() !== componentName);\n  }\n\n  removeChildByIndex(index) {\n    this._children = [...this._children.slice(0, index), ...this._children.slice(index + 1)];\n  }\n\n  getChildByName(componentName) {\n    return this._children.find(component => component.name === componentName);\n  }\n\n  getChildByIndex(index) {\n    return this._children[index];\n  }\n\n  noOfChildren() {\n    return this._children.length;\n  }\n}\n\n// usage\nconst tree = new Composite('root');\ntree.addChild(new Leaf('left'));\nconst right = new Composite('right');\ntree.addChild(right);\nright.addChild(new Leaf('right-left'));\nconst rightMid = new Composite('right-middle');\nright.addChild(rightMid);\nright.addChild(new Leaf('right-right'));\nrightMid.addChild(new Leaf('left-end'));\nrightMid.addChild(new Leaf('right-end'));\n\n// log\nconsole.log(Component.logTreeStructure(tree));\n/*\nroot\n--left\n--right\n----right-left\n----right-middle\n------left-end\n------right-end\n----right-right\n*/\n```","references":"- [Medium - Javascript design patterns by Soumyajit Pathak](https://medium.com/better-programming/javascript-design-patterns-25f0faaaa15)","featured_image_url":"https://codersnack.com/assets/images/design-pattern.jpg","slug":"js-design-patterns-composite","weblink":"https://codersnack.com/js-design-patterns-composite","featured_image_preview":{"id":31,"name":"design-patterns.jpg","hash":"5437612f09f040e786567232e666fc9f","sha256":"VsHmj4Ik_4HvdSZoE8wLe3nE7RbkzGzaMehB3mO1T4A","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":23.12,"url":"/uploads/5437612f09f040e786567232e666fc9f.jpg","provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-01-25T22:45:06.063Z","updated_at":"2020-01-25T22:45:06.063Z"}},"codersnacks_quiz":{"id":22,"question":"Composite composes ...","response_valid":"objects into tree-like structures to represent whole-part hierarchies","response_invalid1":"multiple form fields in a group","response_invalid2":"all object properties in groups","created_at":"2020-01-25T22:48:20.697Z","updated_at":"2020-01-25T22:48:20.697Z"},"codersnacks_category":{"id":3,"header":"Javascript design patterns","description":"Re-usable forms of a solution to common design problem with examples in JS","snacks_by_cat_json_filename":"javascript-design-patterns.snacks.json","key":"javascript-design-patterns","image_url":"https://codersnack.com/assets/images/design-patterns.jpg","created_at":"2019-12-31T19:53:03.454Z","updated_at":"2020-01-27T20:11:09.733Z","image_preview":{"id":5,"name":"design-patterns.jpg","hash":"da61a2c1b67445b99b18a96470e15d63","sha256":"VsHmj4Ik_4HvdSZoE8wLe3nE7RbkzGzaMehB3mO1T4A","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":23.12,"url":"/uploads/da61a2c1b67445b99b18a96470e15d63.jpg","provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2019-12-31T19:53:03.466Z","updated_at":"2019-12-31T19:53:03.466Z"}},"title":"Js design pattern Composite","created_at":"2020-01-25T22:48:49.122Z","updated_at":"2020-01-25T22:48:49.125Z"},{"id":23,"codersnack":{"id":25,"header":"Prototype pattern","created_at":"2020-01-28T09:23:49.527Z","updated_at":"2020-01-30T22:49:30.366Z","explanation":"This pattern is an *object-based creational design pattern*.

It **acts as a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it**.\n\n**It is usually used in situations in which a target object is under constraints and may not be able to handle all its responsibilities efficiently**. A proxy, in this case, usually provides the same interface to the client and adds a level of indirection to support controlled access to the target object to avoid undue pressure on it.\n\nThe proxy pattern can be **very useful when working with network request-heavy applications** to avoid unnecessary or redundant network requests.\n\nIn this **example**, *we will use two new **ES6 features, Proxy and Reflect**.*:\n- **A Proxy object is used to define custom behaviour for fundamental operations of a JavaScript object** (remember, function and arrays are also object in JavaScript). It is a constructor method that can be used to create a Proxy object. It accepts a target object that is to be proxied and a handler object that will define the necessary customisation. The handler object allows for defining some trap functions like get, set, has, apply, etc. that are used to add custom behaviour attached to their usage. \n- **Reflect, on the other hand, is a built-in object that provides similar methods that are supported by the handler object of Proxy as static methods on itself**. It is not a constructor; its static methods are used for intercept-able JavaScript operations.\n\nNow, we create a function that can be thought of as a network request. We named it as *networkFetch*. It accepts a URL and responds accordingly. We want to implement a proxy where *we only get the response from the network if it is not available in our cache. Otherwise, we just return a response from the cache*.\n\nThe *cache global variable will store our cached responses*. We create a proxy named *proxiedNetworkFetch* with our original *networkFetch* as the targetand use apply method in our handler object to proxy the function invocation. The *apply* method gets passed on the target object itself. This value as *thisArg* and the arguments are passed to it in an array-like structure args.\n\nWe check if the passed url argument is in the cache. If it exists in the cache, we return the response from there, never invoking the original target function. If it does not, then we use the *Reflect.apply* method to invoke the *targetfunction* with *thisArg* (although it’s not of any significance in our case here) and the arguments it passed.\n\n```\n// Target\nfunction networkFetch(url) {\n  return `${url} - Response from network`;\n}\n\n// Proxy\n// ES6 Proxy API = new Proxy(target, handler);\nconst cache = [];\nconst proxiedNetworkFetch = new Proxy(networkFetch, {\n  apply(target, thisArg, args) {\n    const urlParam = args[0];\n    if (cache.includes(urlParam)) {\n      return `${urlParam} - Response from cache`;\n    } else {\n      cache.push(urlParam);\n      return Reflect.apply(target, thisArg, args);\n    }\n  },\n});\n\n// usage\nconsole.log(proxiedNetworkFetch('dogPic.jpg')); // 'dogPic.jpg - Response from network'\nconsole.log(proxiedNetworkFetch('dogPic.jpg')); // 'dogPic.jpg - Response from cache'\n```","references":"- [Medium - Javascript design patterns](https://medium.com/better-programming/javascript-design-patterns-25f0faaaa15)\n- [MDN Web docs - ES6 Reflect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Reflect)\n- [MDN Web docs - ES6 Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy)","featured_image_url":"https://codersnack.com/assets/images/design-patterns.jpg","slug":"js-design-patterns-proxy","weblink":"https://codersnack.com/js-design-patterns-proxy/","featured_image_preview":{"id":53,"name":"design-patterns.jpg","hash":"0c6f8403aa214c009d7b286046f40afc","sha256":"VsHmj4Ik_4HvdSZoE8wLe3nE7RbkzGzaMehB3mO1T4A","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":23.12,"url":"/uploads/0c6f8403aa214c009d7b286046f40afc.jpg","provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-02-04T10:08:54.984Z","updated_at":"2020-02-04T10:08:54.984Z"}},"codersnacks_quiz":{"id":39,"question":"Proxy pattern is usually used in ...","response_valid":"situations in which a target object is under constraints and may not be able to handle all its responsibilities efficiently","response_invalid1":"situations where there is a proxy server to connect to backend","response_invalid2":"complex scenarios in terms of business logic to hide this logic to other layers of the app","created_at":"2020-02-04T10:15:43.566Z","updated_at":"2020-02-04T10:15:43.566Z"},"codersnacks_category":{"id":3,"header":"Javascript design patterns","description":"Re-usable forms of a solution to common design problem with examples in JS","snacks_by_cat_json_filename":"javascript-design-patterns.snacks.json","key":"javascript-design-patterns","image_url":"https://codersnack.com/assets/images/design-patterns.jpg","created_at":"2019-12-31T19:53:03.454Z","updated_at":"2020-01-27T20:11:09.733Z","image_preview":{"id":5,"name":"design-patterns.jpg","hash":"da61a2c1b67445b99b18a96470e15d63","sha256":"VsHmj4Ik_4HvdSZoE8wLe3nE7RbkzGzaMehB3mO1T4A","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":23.12,"url":"/uploads/da61a2c1b67445b99b18a96470e15d63.jpg","provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2019-12-31T19:53:03.466Z","updated_at":"2019-12-31T19:53:03.466Z"}},"title":"Js design pattern Proxy is usually used in","created_at":"2020-02-04T10:16:17.684Z","updated_at":"2020-02-04T10:16:17.687Z"},{"id":40,"codersnack":{"id":43,"header":"Observer Pattern","created_at":"2020-02-04T10:26:42.213Z","updated_at":"2020-02-04T10:26:42.213Z","explanation":"It is a crucial *behavioural design pattern* that **defines one-to-many dependencies between objects so that when one object (publisher) changes its state, all the other dependent objects (subscribers) are notified and updated automatically.** This is also called **PubSub (publisher/subscribers) or event dispatcher/listeners pattern**. The publisher is sometimes called the **subject**, and the subscribers are sometimes called **observers**.\n\nChances are, you’re already somewhat familiar with this pattern if you have used **addEventListener or jQuery’s** .on to write even-handling code. It has its influences in **Reactive Programming (think RxJS)** as well.\n\nIn the **example**, we create a simple *Subject* class that has methods to add and remove objects of *Observer* class from subscriber collection. Also, a *fire method* to propagate any changes in the *Subject* class object to the subscribed *Observers*. The *Observer* class, on the other hand, has its internal state and a method to update its internal state based on the change propagated from the *Subject* it has subscribed to.\n```\nclass Subject {\n  constructor() {\n    this._observers = [];\n  }\n\n  subscribe(observer) {\n    this._observers.push(observer);\n  }\n\n  unsubscribe(observer) {\n    this._observers = this._observers.filter(obs => observer !== obs);\n  }\n\n  fire(change) {\n    this._observers.forEach(observer => {\n      observer.update(change);\n    });\n  }\n}\n\nclass Observer {\n  constructor(state) {\n    this.state = state;\n    this.initialState = state;\n  }\n\n  update(change) {\n    let state = this.state;\n    switch (change) {\n      case 'INC':\n        this.state = ++state;\n        break;\n      case 'DEC':\n        this.state = --state;\n        break;\n      default:\n        this.state = this.initialState;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// usage\nconst sub = new Subject();\n\nconst obs1 = new Observer(1);\nconst obs2 = new Observer(19);\n\nsub.subscribe(obs1);\nsub.subscribe(obs2);\n\nsub.fire('INC');\n\nconsole.log(obs1.state); // 2\nconsole.log(obs2.state); // 20\n\n```","references":"- [Medium - Javascript design patterns](https://medium.com/better-programming/javascript-design-patterns-25f0faaaa15)","featured_image_url":"https://codersnack.com/assets/images/design-patterns.jpg","slug":"js-design-patterns-observer","weblink":"https://codersnack.com/js-design-patterns-observer/","featured_image_preview":{"id":54,"name":"design-patterns.jpg","hash":"282d95353af342298c7d16247c9e621a","sha256":"VsHmj4Ik_4HvdSZoE8wLe3nE7RbkzGzaMehB3mO1T4A","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":23.12,"url":"/uploads/282d95353af342298c7d16247c9e621a.jpg","provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-02-04T10:26:42.221Z","updated_at":"2020-02-04T10:26:42.221Z"}},"codersnacks_quiz":{"id":40,"question":"Observer pattern defines ...","response_valid":"one-to-many dependencies between objects so that when one object (publisher) changes its state, all the other dependent objects (subscribers) are notified and updated automatically","response_invalid1":"relations between presentational components and statefull components for data communication","response_invalid2":"some rules between related components in terms of exchanging data","created_at":"2020-02-04T10:32:04.880Z","updated_at":"2020-02-04T10:32:04.880Z"},"codersnacks_category":{"id":3,"header":"Javascript design patterns","description":"Re-usable forms of a solution to common design problem with examples in JS","snacks_by_cat_json_filename":"javascript-design-patterns.snacks.json","key":"javascript-design-patterns","image_url":"https://codersnack.com/assets/images/design-patterns.jpg","created_at":"2019-12-31T19:53:03.454Z","updated_at":"2020-01-27T20:11:09.733Z","image_preview":{"id":5,"name":"design-patterns.jpg","hash":"da61a2c1b67445b99b18a96470e15d63","sha256":"VsHmj4Ik_4HvdSZoE8wLe3nE7RbkzGzaMehB3mO1T4A","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":23.12,"url":"/uploads/da61a2c1b67445b99b18a96470e15d63.jpg","provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2019-12-31T19:53:03.466Z","updated_at":"2019-12-31T19:53:03.466Z"}},"title":"Js design pattern Observer defines","created_at":"2020-02-04T10:32:37.126Z","updated_at":"2020-02-04T10:32:37.131Z"},{"id":41,"codersnack":{"id":44,"header":"State pattern","created_at":"2020-02-04T11:03:08.671Z","updated_at":"2020-02-04T11:03:08.671Z","explanation":"It is a *behavioural design pattern* that **allows an object to alter its behaviour based on changes to its internal state**.
