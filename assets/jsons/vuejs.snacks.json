The directives offer functionality to HTML applications,and come as either built-in or user defined directives.\n\n#### History\nVue was created by Evan You after working for Google using AngularJS in a number of projects. He later summed up his thought process: \n>-I figured, what if I could just extract the part that I really liked about Angular and build something really lightweight-\n\nThe first source code commit to the project was dated July 2013, and Vue was first released the following February, in 2014.","references":"- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vue.js)\n- [Official website](https://vuejs.org/)","featured_image_url":"https://codersnack.com/assets/images/vuejs-icon.png","slug":"vuejs-introduction","weblink":"https://codersnack.com/vuejs-introduction/","featured_image_preview":{"id":38,"name":"vuejs-icon.png","hash":"adae1ae4cce84c71aa20681fea0f1923","sha256":"G3nHfDw2Z2VTPtj6qSGNJ3qoSEP6-gHeoE6X-RgYpc4","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":43.55,"url":"/uploads/adae1ae4cce84c71aa20681fea0f1923.png","provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-01-28T13:23:32.523Z","updated_at":"2020-01-28T13:23:32.523Z"}},"codersnacks_category":{"id":7,"header":"Vuejs","description":"A progressive, incrementally-adoptable JavaScript framework for building UI on the web","snacks_by_cat_json_filename":"vuejs.snacks.json","key":"vuejs","image_url":"https://codersnack.com/assets/images/vuejs-icon.png","created_at":"2020-01-28T12:01:29.597Z","updated_at":"2020-01-28T12:01:29.597Z","image_preview":{"id":37,"name":"vuejs-icon.png","hash":"e4d028af5a5545248812d725ae0da6b1","sha256":"G3nHfDw2Z2VTPtj6qSGNJ3qoSEP6-gHeoE6X-RgYpc4","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":43.55,"url":"/uploads/e4d028af5a5545248812d725ae0da6b1.png","provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-01-28T12:01:29.606Z","updated_at":"2020-01-28T12:01:29.606Z"}},"title":"Vuejs introduction","created_at":"2020-01-28T13:23:53.570Z","updated_at":"2020-01-28T13:23:53.579Z"}]
