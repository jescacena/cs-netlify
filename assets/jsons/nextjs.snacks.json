You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering\n- You might have to write some **server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.**\n\nA framework can solve these problems. But such a framework must have the right level of abstraction — otherwise it won’t be very useful. It also needs to have great \"Developer Experience\", ensuring you and your team have an amazing experience while writing code.\n\n## Next.js: The React Framework\nEnter Next.js, the React Framework. Next.js provides a solution to all of the above problems. But more importantly, it puts you and your team in the pit of success when building React applications.\nNext.js has the best-in-class \"Developer Experience\" and many built-in features; a sample of them are:\n- An intuitive **page-based routing system** (with support for dynamic routes)\n- **Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG)** and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis\n- **Automatic code splitting** for faster page loads\n- **Client-side routing** with optimized prefetching\n- **Built-in CSS and Sass support**, and support for any CSS-in-JS library\n- Development environment with **Fast Refresh support**\n- **API routes to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions**\n- Fully extendable\n\nNext.js is used in tens of thousands of production-facing websites and web applications, including many of the world's largest brands.\n\n**Image Optimization**\n```<Image>``` and Automatic Image Optimization with instant builds.\n\n**Internationalization**\nBuilt-in Domain and Subdomain Routing and Automatic Language detection.\n\n**Next.js Analytics**\nA true lighthouse score based on real visitor data & page-by-page insights\n\n**Zero Config**\nAutomatic compilation and bundling.

You’ll need **Node.js version 10.13 or later**.\n\nYou’ll be using your own text editor and terminal app for this tutorial.\n\nIf you are on Windows, we recommend downloading Git for Windows and use Git Bash that comes with it, which supports the UNIX-specific commands in this tutorial. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is another option.\n\nTo create a Next.js app, open your terminal, cd into the directory you’d like to create the app in, and run the following command:\n```\nnpx create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-npm --example \"https://github.com/vercel/next-learn-starter/tree/master/learn-starter\"\n``` \nUnder the hood, this uses the tool called create-next-app, which bootstraps a Next.js app for you. It uses this template through the ```--example```  flag.\n\n\n**Run the development server**\nYou now have a new directory called nextjs-blog. Let’s cd into it:\n```\ncd nextjs-blog\n``` \nThen, run the following command:\n``` \nnpm run dev\n``` \n\nThis starts your Next.js app’s \"development server\" (more on this later) on port 3000.\n\nLet’s check to see if it’s working. Open ```http://localhost:3000```  from your browser.\n\n## Editing the Page\nLet’s try editing the starter page.\n\nMake sure the Next.js development server is still running.\nOpen ```pages/index.js```  with your text editor.\nFind the text that says “Welcome to” under the ```<h1>```  tag and change it to \"Learn\".\nSave the file.\nAs soon as you save the file, the browser automatically updates the page with the new text\n\nThe Next.js development server has **Fast Refresh** enabled. When you make changes to files, Next.js automatically applies the changes in the browser almost instantly. No refresh needed!

For example, in development:\n\n- ```pages/index.js``` is associated with the ```/``` route.\n- ```pages/posts/first-post.js``` is associated with the ```/posts/first-post``` route.\n\nWe already have the ```pages/index.js``` file, so let’s create ```pages/posts/first-post.js``` to see how it works.\n\n## Create a New Page\nCreate the posts directory under pages.\n\nCreate a file called first-post.js inside the posts directory with the following content:\n\n```\nexport default function FirstPost() {\n  return <h1>First Post</h1>\n}\n```\nThe component can have any name, but you must export it as a default export.\n\nNow, make sure that the development server is running and visit ```http://localhost:3000/posts/first-post```. You should see the page:\n\nFirst Post\n\nThis is how you can create different pages in Next.js.\n\nSimply create a JS file under the pages directory, and the path to the file becomes the URL path.\n\nIn a way, this is similar to building websites using HTML or PHP files. Instead of writing HTML you write JSX and use React Components.\n\nLet's add a link to the newly added page so that we can navigate to it from the homepage.\n\n## Link Component\nWhen linking between pages on websites, you use the ```<a>``` HTML tag.\n\nIn Next.js, you use the **Link** Component from ```next/link``` to wrap the ```<a>``` tag. ```<Link>``` allows you to do client-side navigation to a different page in the application.\n\n### Using Link\nFirst, open ```pages/index.js```, and import the Link component from next/link by adding this line at the top:\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n```\nThen find the h1 tag that looks like this:\n\n```\n<h1 className=\"title\">\n  Learn <a href=\"https://nextjs.org\">Next.js!</a>\n</h1>\n```\n\nAnd change it to:\n\n```\n<h1 className=\"title\">\n  Read{' '}\n  <Link href=\"/posts/first-post\">\n    <a>this page!</a>\n  </Link>\n</h1>\n```\n{' '} adds an empty space, which is used to divide text over multiple lines.\n\nNext, open **pages/posts/first-post.js** and replace its content with the following:\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function FirstPost() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>First Post</h1>\n      <h2>\n        <Link href=\"/\">\n          <a>Back to home</a>\n        </Link>\n      </h2>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, the Link component is similar to using ```<a>``` tags, but instead of ```<a href=\"…\">```, you use ```<Link href=\"…\">``` and put an ```<a>``` tag inside.\n\nLet’s check to see if it works. You should now have a link on each page, allowing you to go back and forth.\n\n## Client-Side Navigation\nThe **Link component enables client-side navigation between two pages** in the same Next.js app.\n\nClient-side navigation means that the page transition **happens using JavaScript**, which is faster than the default navigation done by the browser.\n\nHere’s a simple way you can verify it:\n\nUse the browser’s developer tools to change the background CSS property of ```<html>``` to yellow.\nClick on the links to go back and forth between the two pages.\nYou’ll see that the yellow background persists between page transitions.\nThis shows that the browser does not load the full page and client-side navigation is working.\n\n## Links\nIf you’ve used ```<a href=\"…\">``` instead of ```<Link href=\"…\">``` and did this, the background color will be cleared on link clicks because the browser does a full refresh.\n\n## Code splitting and prefetching\nNext.js does code splitting **automatically**, so **each page only loads what’s necessary for that page**. That means when the homepage is rendered, the code for other pages is not served initially.\n\nThis ensures that the **homepage loads quickly even if you have hundreds of pages**.\n\nOnly loading the code for the page you request also means that pages become isolated. If a certain page throws an error, the rest of the application would still work.\n\nFurthermore, in a production build of Next.js, whenever Link components appear in the browser’s viewport, **Next.js automatically prefetches the code for the linked page in the background**. By the time you click the link, the code for the destination page will already be loaded in the background, and the page transition will be near-instant!\n\n## Summary\nNext.js automatically optimizes your application for the best performance by code splitting, client-side navigation, and prefetching (in production).\n\nYou create routes as files under pages and use the built-in Link component. No routing libraries are required.\n\nYou can learn more about the Link component in the API reference for ```next/link``` and routing in general in the routing documentation.\n\nNote: If you need to link to an external page outside the Next.js app, just use an ```<a>``` tag without Link.\n\nIf you need to add attributes like, for example, **className**, **add it to the a tag, not to the Link tag.** Here’s an example.\n\n\n\n","references":"[NextJs - Navigating between pages - Client side](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/navigate-between-pages/client-side)","featured_image_url":"https://codersnack.com/assets/images/nextjs-logo.png","slug":"nextjs-navigating-between-pages","weblink":"https://codersnack.com/nextjs-navigating-between-pages/","featured_image_preview":{"id":122,"name":"nextjs-logo.png","hash":"79f644b29b884d70a547bcd887e5dedf","sha256":"X-p-BaME7xopk3LcdT2Jm5xZvWt7sZDr0RCDltOUt1g","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":19.63,"url":"/uploads/79f644b29b884d70a547bcd887e5dedf.png","provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-03-22T21:52:11.648Z","updated_at":"2021-03-22T21:52:11.648Z"}},"codersnacks_category":{"id":17,"header":"NextJS","description":"The React Framework for Production\nNext.js gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more.

Files inside public can be referenced from the root of the application similar to pages.\n\nThe public directory is also useful for robots.txt, Google Site Verification, and any other static assets. Check out the documentation for Static File Serving to learn more.\n\n\n####  Download Your Profile Picture\n\nFirst, let's retrieve your profile picture.\n\n- Download your profile picture in .jpg format (or use this file).\n- Create an images directory inside of the public directory.\n- Save the picture as profile.jpg in the public/images directory.\n- The image size can be around 400px by 400px.\n- You may remove the unused SVG logo file directly under the public directory.\n\n\n####  Unoptimized Image\n\nWith regular HTML, you would add your profile picture as follows:\n\n```\n<img src=\"/images/profile.jpg\" alt=\"Your Name\" />\n```\n\nHowever, this means you have to manually handle:\n\n- Ensuring your image is responsive on different screen sizes\n- Optimizing your images with a third-party tool or library\n- Only loading images when they enter the viewport\n\nAnd more. Instead, Next.js **provides an *Image* component out of the box to handle this for you.**\n\n####  Image Component and Image Optimization\n\n***next/image* is an extension of the HTML ```<img>```  element, evolved for the modern web.**\n\n**Next.js also has support for Image Optimization by default. This allows for resizing, optimizing, and serving images in modern formats like *WebP* when the browser supports it.** This avoids shipping large images to devices with a smaller viewport. It also allows Next.js to automatically adopt future image formats and serve them to browsers that support those formats.\n\n**Automatic Image Optimization works with any image source.** Even if the image is hosted by an external data source, like a CMS, it can still be optimized.\n\n####  Using the Image Component\n\n**Instead of optimizing images at build time, *Next.js optimizes images on-demand*, as users request them**. Unlike static site generators and static-only solutions, your build times aren't increased, whether shipping 10 images or 10 million images.\n\n**Images are lazy loaded by default. That means your page speed isn't penalized for images outside the viewport. Images load as they are scrolled into viewport.**\n\nImages are always rendered in such a way as to avoid [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/), a Core Web Vital that Google is going to use in search ranking.\n\n**Here's an example using *next/image* to display our profile picture**. The height and width props should be the desired rendering size, with an aspect ratio identical to the source image.\n\n> **Note**: We'll use this component later in \"Polishing Layout\", no need to copy it yet.\n\n```\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\nconst YourComponent = () => (\n  <Image\n    src=\"/images/profile.jpg\" // Route of the image file\n    height={144} // Desired size with correct aspect ratio\n    width={144} // Desired size with correct aspect ratio\n    alt=\"Your Name\"\n  />\n)\n```\n\n> To learn more about Automatic Image Optimization, check out the [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization).\nTo learn more about the Image component, check out the API reference for [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image).\n\n\n\n###  Metadata\n\nWhat if we wanted to modify the metadata of the page, such as the ```<title>``` HTML tag?\n\n```<title>``` is part of the ```<head>``` HTML tag, so let's dive into **how we can modify the ```<head>``` tag in a Next.js page.**\n\nOpen pages/index.js in your editor and find the following lines:\n\n```\n<Head>\n  <title>Create Next App</title>\n  <link rel=\"icon\" href=\"/favicon.ico\" />\n</Head>\n```\nNotice that ```<Head>``` is used instead of the lowercase ```<head>```. ```<Head>``` is a React Component that is built into Next.js. It allows you to modify the ```<head>``` of a page.\n\nYou can import the Head component from the next/head module.\n\n\n###  Adding Head to first-post.js\n\nWe haven't added a ```<title>``` to our **/posts/first-post** route. Let's add one.\n\nOpen the **pages/posts/first-post.js** file and add an import for *Head* from next/head at the beginning of the file:\n\n```\nimport Head from 'next/head'\n```\nThen, update the exported FirstPost component to include the Head component. For now, we‘ll add just the title tag:\n\n```\nexport default function FirstPost() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Head>\n        <title>First Post</title>\n      </Head>\n      <h1>First Post</h1>\n      <h2>\n        <Link href=\"/\">\n          <a>Back to home</a>\n        </Link>\n      </h2>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\nTry accessing *http://localhost:3000/posts/first-post*. The browser tab should now say “First Post”. By using your browser’s developer tools, you should see that the title tag is added to ```<head>```.\n\n> To learn more about the Head component, check out the API reference for next/head.\n\nIf you want to **customize the ```<html>``` tag**, for example to add the lang attribute, you can do so by creating a **pages/_document.js** file. Learn more in the custom Document documentation.\n\n\n###   Third-Party JavaScript\n\nThird-party JavaScript refers to any scripts that are added from a third-party source. Usually, third-party scripts are included in order to introduce newer functionality into a site that does not need to be written from scratch, such as analytics, ads, and customer support widgets.\n\n####  Adding Third-Party JavaScript\n\nLet's dive into how we can add a third-party script to a Next.js page.\n\nOpen **pages/posts/first-post.js** in your editor and find the following lines:\n\n```\n<Head>\n  <title>First Post</title>\n</Head>\n```\nIn addition to metadata, **scripts that need to load and execute as soon as possible are usually added within the ```<head>``` of a page**. Using a regular HTML ```<script>``` element, an external script would be added as follows:\n\n```\n<Head>\n  <title>First Post</title>\n  <script src=\"https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js\" />\n</Head>\n```\n\nThis script contains the Facebook SDK which is commonly used to introduce Facebook social plugins and other functionality. **Although this approach works, including scripts in this manner does not give a clear idea of when it would load with respect to the other JavaScript code fetched on the same page**. If a particular script is render-blocking and can delay page content from loading, this can signficiantly impact performance.\n\n\n#### Using the Script Component\n\n**next/script** is an extension of the HTML ```<script>``` element and **optimizes when additional scripts are fetched and executed.**\n\nIn the same file, add an import for Script from next/script at the beginning of the file:\n\n```\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n```\nNow, update the FirstPost component to include the Script component:\n\n```\nexport default function FirstPost() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Head>\n        <title>First Post</title>\n      </Head>\n      <Script\n        src=\"https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js\"\n        strategy=\"lazyOnload\"\n        onLoad={() =>\n          console.log(`script loaded correctly, window.FB has been populated`)\n        }\n      />\n      <h1>First Post</h1>\n      <h2>\n        <Link href=\"/\">\n          <a>Back to home</a>\n        </Link>\n      </h2>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nNotice that a few additional properties have been defined in the Script component:\n\n- **strategy** controls **when the third-party script should load**. A value of ***lazyOnload*** tells Next.js to load this particular script **lazily during browser idle time**\n\n- **onLoad** is used to **run any JavaScript code immediately after the script has finished loading**. In this example, we log a message to the console that mentions that the script has loaded correctly\n\nTry accessing http://localhost:3000/posts/first-post. By using your browser’s developer tools, you should see the message above logged in the Console panel. In addition, you can run window.FB to see that the script has populated this global variable.\n\n> **Note**: The Facebook SDK was only used as a contrived example to show how to add third-party scripts to your application in a performant way.
