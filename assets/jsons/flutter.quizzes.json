In other words, it’s a **comprehensive app Software Development Kit (SDK)**, complete with widgets and tools.\n\n#### What's Flutter for?\nFlutter **enables cross-platform app development**. It gives developers an easy way to build and deploy visually attractive, natively-compiled applications for mobile (iOS, Android), web, and desktop `–` all using a single codebase.\n\n#### Who created Flutter?\nA **team at Google built Flutter**. But as an **open-source** project, both Google and the Flutter community contribute to its development. A brief history:\n- February 2018, Mobile World Congress `–` First beta release of Flutter\n- September 2019, Flutter 1.9 release\n\nFlutter is now **one of the top 20 active software repositories** on GitHub (16th place as of December 11, 2019), which proves the developer community uses it and continues to contribute to its improvement.\n\n#### A little more about Flutter\n\n- It's **free** and **open source**\n- It's based on **Dart** , a fast, object-oriented programming language (Google released Dart 2.3 with new support for UI-as-code features , note that Dart is now in its 2.6 version). Dart is relatively new, and is easy to learn , especially for experienced developers more familiar with Java and C#\n- The architecture is based on the very popular **reactive programming** (it follows the same style as React)\n- It provides its **own widgets, drawn from its own high-performance rendering engine** , these are fast, attractive and customizable\n- Thanks to the widget experience,**Flutter apps have a great look and feel** (while you can still create your own custom app design using readily-available UI elements that follow specific platform guidelines)","references":"- [TheDroidsOnRoids - Flutter vs React Native](https://www.thedroidsonroids.com/blog/flutter-vs-react-native-what-to-choose-in-2020#whatisflutter)\n- [Official Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/)","featured_image_url":"https://codersnack.com/assets/images/flutter-icon.png","slug":"flutter-introduction","weblink":"https://codersnack.com/flutter-introduction/","featured_image_preview":{"id":36,"name":"flutter-icon.png","hash":"f8b80dc3442a4e2a915af3c32dbd0cd9","sha256":"yaVsbcnLjjeqMcEIIRkabwrUwbN_FxEGtX4+XCfenu8","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":8.14,"url":"/uploads/f8b80dc3442a4e2a915af3c32dbd0cd9.png","provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-01-28T11:52:00.990Z","updated_at":"2020-01-28T11:52:00.990Z"}},"codersnacks_quiz":{"id":56,"question":"With Flutter you can build and deploy applications for ...","response_valid":"mobile (iOS, Android), web and desktop","response_invalid1":"mobile (iOS, Android)","response_invalid2":"mobile (iOS, Android) and web","created_at":"2020-04-20T19:15:11.509Z","updated_at":"2020-04-20T19:15:11.509Z"},"codersnacks_category":{"id":6,"header":"Flutter","description":"Google's UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase","snacks_by_cat_json_filename":"flutter.snacks.json","key":"flutter","image_url":"https://codersnack.com/assets/images/flutter-icon.png","created_at":"2020-01-28T11:35:43.152Z","updated_at":"2020-01-28T20:51:19.717Z","image_preview":{"id":35,"name":"flutter-icon.png","hash":"c9fbe91f87954d58b76ca53c8524cbfe","sha256":"yaVsbcnLjjeqMcEIIRkabwrUwbN_FxEGtX4+XCfenu8","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":8.14,"url":"/uploads/c9fbe91f87954d58b76ca53c8524cbfe.png","provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-01-28T11:35:43.164Z","updated_at":"2020-01-28T11:35:43.164Z"}},"title":"Flutter - With Flutter you can build and deploy","created_at":"2020-04-20T19:15:53.318Z","updated_at":"2020-04-20T19:15:53.322Z"}]
