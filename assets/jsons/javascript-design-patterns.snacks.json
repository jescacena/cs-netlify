These problems usually have many similarities, and, when trying to solve them, we notice several common patterns. This is where design patterns come in.\n\n> A design pattern is a term used in software engineering for a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.\n\n*Design patterns are by no means finished solutions*. They only provide us with **approaches or schemes to solve a problem**. The underlying concept of design patterns has been around in the software engineering industry since the very beginning, but they weren't really so formalised. \n\nDesign patterns are beneficial for various reasons. They are proven solutions that industry veterans have tried and tested. They are solid approaches that solve issues in a widely accepted way and reflect the experience and insights of the industry-leading developers that helped define them. Patterns also **make your code more reusable and readable while speeding up the development process vastly**.\n\n**Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (1994)** is a software engineering book describing software design patterns. The book was written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, with a foreword by Grady Booch. The book is divided into two parts, with the first two chapters exploring the capabilities and pitfalls of object-oriented programming, and the remaining chapters describing 23 classic software design patterns. The book includes examples in C++ and Smalltalk.\n\n### Categories of Design Patterns\nDesign patterns are usually categorized into three major groups.\n\n#### Creational Design Patterns\nAs the name suggests, these patterns are for handling object creational mechanisms. A creational design pattern basically solves a problem by **controlling the creation process of an object**.\nIncludes: *Constructor Pattern*, *Factory Pattern*, *Prototype Pattern*, and *Singleton Pattern*.\n\n#### Structural Design Patterns\nThese patterns are concerned with **class and object composition**. They help structure or restructure one or more parts without affecting the entire system. In other words, they help obtain new functionalities without tampering with the existing ones.\nIncludes: *Adapter Pattern*, *Composite Pattern*, *Decorator Pattern,* *Fa√ßade Pattern*, *Flyweight Pattern*, and *Proxy Pattern*.\n\n#### Behavioral Design Patterns\nThese patterns are concerned with **improving communication between dissimilar objects**.\nIncludes: *Chain of Responsibility Pattern*, *Command Pattern*, *Iterator Pattern*, *Mediator Pattern*, *Observer Pattern*, *State Pattern*, S*trategy Pattern*, and *Template Pattern*.\n","references":"- [Medium - javascript design patterns](https://medium.com/better-programming/javascript-design-patterns-25f0faaaa15?)\n- [Wikipedia - Desgin Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)","featured_image_url":"https://codersnack.com/assets/images/design-patterns.jpg","slug":"design-pattern-what-is","weblink":"https://codersnack.com/what-is-a-design-pattern","featured_image_preview":{"id":13,"name":"design-patterns.jpg","hash":"4f21ae7a28fc41a892d1e97913389dc0","sha256":"VsHmj4Ik_4HvdSZoE8wLe3nE7RbkzGzaMehB3mO1T4A","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":23.12,"url":"/uploads/4f21ae7a28fc41a892d1e97913389dc0.jpg","provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-01-09T20:02:23.437Z","updated_at":"2020-01-09T20:02:23.437Z"}},"codersnacks_category":{"id":3,"header":"Javascript design patterns","description":"Re-usable forms of a solution to common design problem with examples in JS","snacks_by_cat_json_filename":"javascript-design-patterns.snacks.json","key":"javascript-design-patterns","image_url":"https://codersnack.com/assets/images/design-patterns.jpg","created_at":"2019-12-31T19:53:03.454Z","updated_at":"2020-01-27T20:11:09.733Z","image_preview":{"id":5,"name":"design-patterns.jpg","hash":"da61a2c1b67445b99b18a96470e15d63","sha256":"VsHmj4Ik_4HvdSZoE8wLe3nE7RbkzGzaMehB3mO1T4A","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":23.12,"url":"/uploads/da61a2c1b67445b99b18a96470e15d63.jpg","provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2019-12-31T19:53:03.466Z","updated_at":"2019-12-31T19:53:03.466Z"}},"title":"Design Pattern - What is","created_at":"2020-01-05T22:14:22.613Z","updated_at":"2020-01-05T22:14:22.618Z"},{"id":20,"codersnack":{"id":20,"header":"Adapter pattern","created_at":"2020-01-25T18:44:26.680Z","updated_at":"2020-01-25T18:44:26.680Z","explanation":"This is a *structural pattern* where **the interface of one class is translated into another**. \n\nThis pattern **lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces**.\n\nThis pattern is **often used to create wrappers for new refactored APIs so that other existing old APIs can still work with them**. This is usually done when new implementations or code refactoring (done for reasons like performance gains) result in a different public API, while the other parts of the system are still using the old API and need to be adapted to work together.\n\nIn this example, we have an old API, i.e. *OldCalculator* class, and a new API, i.e. *NewCalculator* class. The *OldCalculator* class provides an *operation* method for both addition and subtraction, while the *NewCalculator* provides separate methods for addition and subtraction.

In this pattern, each node in the tree-like structure can be either an individual object or a composed collection of objects. Regardless, each node is treated uniformly.\n\nIt is a bit complex to visualize this pattern. **The easiest way to think about this is with the example of a multi-level menu**. Each node can be a distinct option, or it can be a menu itself, which has multiple options as its child. A node component with children is a composite component, while a node component without any child is a leaf component.\n\nIn this example, we create a base class of *Component* that implements the common functionalities needed and abstracts the other methods needed. The base class also has a static method that utilises *recursion to traverse a composite tree structure made with its subclasses*. Then we create two subclasses extending the base class ‚Äî *Leaf* that does not have any children and *Composite* that can have children‚Äîand hence have methods handling adding, searching, and removing child functionalities. The two subclasses are used to create a composite structure‚Äîa tree, in this case.\n\n```\nclass Component {\n  constructor(name) {\n    this._name = name;\n  }\n\n  getNodeName() {\n    return this._name;\n  }\n\n  // abstract methods that need to be overridden\n  getType() {}\n\n  addChild(component) {}\n\n  removeChildByName(componentName) {}\n\n  removeChildByIndex(index) {}\n\n  getChildByName(componentName) {}\n\n  getChildByIndex(index) {}\n\n  noOfChildren() {}\n\n  static logTreeStructure(root) {\n    let treeStructure = '';\n    function traverse(node, indent = 0) {\n      treeStructure += `${'--'.repeat(indent)}${node.getNodeName()}\\n`;\n      indent++;\n      for (let i = 0, length = node.noOfChildren(); i < length; i++) {\n        traverse(node.getChildByIndex(i), indent);\n      }\n    }\n\n    traverse(root);\n    return treeStructure;\n  }\n}\n\nclass Leaf extends Component {\n  constructor(name) {\n    super(name);\n    this._type = 'Leaf Node';\n  }\n\n  getType() {\n    return this._type;\n  }\n\n  noOfChildren() {\n    return 0;\n  }\n}\n\nclass Composite extends Component {\n  constructor(name) {\n    super(name);\n    this._type = 'Composite Node';\n    this._children = [];\n  }\n\n  getType() {\n    return this._type;\n  }\n\n  addChild(component) {\n    this._children = [...this._children, component];\n  }\n\n  removeChildByName(componentName) {\n    this._children = [...this._children].filter(component => component.getNodeName() !== componentName);\n  }\n\n  removeChildByIndex(index) {\n    this._children = [...this._children.slice(0, index), ...this._children.slice(index + 1)];\n  }\n\n  getChildByName(componentName) {\n    return this._children.find(component => component.name === componentName);\n  }\n\n  getChildByIndex(index) {\n    return this._children[index];\n  }\n\n  noOfChildren() {\n    return this._children.length;\n  }\n}\n\n// usage\nconst tree = new Composite('root');\ntree.addChild(new Leaf('left'));\nconst right = new Composite('right');\ntree.addChild(right);\nright.addChild(new Leaf('right-left'));\nconst rightMid = new Composite('right-middle');\nright.addChild(rightMid);\nright.addChild(new Leaf('right-right'));\nrightMid.addChild(new Leaf('left-end'));\nrightMid.addChild(new Leaf('right-end'));\n\n// log\nconsole.log(Component.logTreeStructure(tree));\n/*\nroot\n--left\n--right\n----right-left\n----right-middle\n------left-end\n------right-end\n----right-right\n*/\n```","references":"- [Medium - Composite pattern](https://medium.com/better-programming/javascript-design-patterns-25f0faaaa15)","featured_image_url":"https://codersnack.com/assets/images/design-pattern.jpg","slug":"js-design-patterns-composite","weblink":"https://codersnack.com/js-design-patterns-composite","featured_image_preview":{"id":31,"name":"design-patterns.jpg","hash":"5437612f09f040e786567232e666fc9f","sha256":"VsHmj4Ik_4HvdSZoE8wLe3nE7RbkzGzaMehB3mO1T4A","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":23.12,"url":"/uploads/5437612f09f040e786567232e666fc9f.jpg","provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-01-25T22:45:06.063Z","updated_at":"2020-01-25T22:45:06.063Z"}},"codersnacks_category":{"id":3,"header":"Javascript design patterns","description":"Re-usable forms of a solution to common design problem with examples in JS","snacks_by_cat_json_filename":"javascript-design-patterns.snacks.json","key":"javascript-design-patterns","image_url":"https://codersnack.com/assets/images/design-patterns.jpg","created_at":"2019-12-31T19:53:03.454Z","updated_at":"2020-01-27T20:11:09.733Z","image_preview":{"id":5,"name":"design-patterns.jpg","hash":"da61a2c1b67445b99b18a96470e15d63","sha256":"VsHmj4Ik_4HvdSZoE8wLe3nE7RbkzGzaMehB3mO1T4A","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":23.12,"url":"/uploads/da61a2c1b67445b99b18a96470e15d63.jpg","provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2019-12-31T19:53:03.466Z","updated_at":"2019-12-31T19:53:03.466Z"}},"title":"Js design pattern composite","created_at":"2020-01-25T22:45:24.696Z","updated_at":"2020-01-25T22:45:24.701Z"},{"id":24,"codersnack":{"id":25,"header":"Prototype pattern","created_at":"2020-01-28T09:23:49.527Z","updated_at":"2020-01-28T09:23:49.527Z","explanation":"This pattern is an *object-based creational design pattern*.

It is another viable alternative to sub-classing.\n\nThe decorator type behaviour is very easy to implement in JavaScript because **JavaScript allows us to add methods and properties to object dynamically**. The simplest approach would be to just add a property to an object, but it will not be efficiently reusable.\n\nIn this **example**, we create a *Book* class.

If you are a **Redux** user, you have already come across the command pattern. The actions that allow the awesome **time-travel debugging feature are nothing but encapsulated operations that can be tracked to redo or undo operations**. Hence, time-travelling made possible.\n\nIn this **example**, we have a class called *SpecialMath* that has multiple methods and a *Command* class that encapsulates commands that are to be executed on its subject, i.e. an object of the *SpecialMath* class.
